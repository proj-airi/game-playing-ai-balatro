> This project is part of (and also associate to) the [Project AIRI](https://github.com/moeru-ai/airi), we aim to build a LLM-driven VTuber like [Neuro-sama](https://www.youtube.com/@Neurosama) (subscribe if you didn't!) if you are interested in, please do give it a try on [live demo](https://airi.moeru.ai).
>
> Who are we?
>
> We are a group of currently non-funded talented people made up with computer scientists, experts in multi-modal fields, designers, product managers, and popular open source contributors who loves the goal of where we are heading now.

## Development

```shell
git clone git@github.com:proj-airi/game-playing-ai-balatro.git
git lfs install
git submodule init
git submodule update

pixi install
```

> [!NOTE]
> For macOS, when running the UI automation and doing Game AI playing, you may need to give the terminal (or your IDE, in our case, Visual Studio Code) the permissions:
>
> - Access to other apps
>   ![](./docs/permissions-macos-1.png)
> - Screen Recording
>   ![](./docs/permissions-macos-2.png)
> - Bypass private window picker
>   ![](./docs/permissions-macos-3.png)
> - Accessibility
>   ![](./docs/permissions-macos-4.png)
>
> After assigning the permissions, please restart your terminal or IDE to make it work.

### Reproduce

1. Through script

```shell
pixi shell
python src/main.py
```

2. Through Notebook

Open `src/notebooks/Train.ipynb` and run all cells.

### Technical reports

#### Training

We trained this model on our own datasets labelled with n<1k images using Label Studio with YOLOv11n as the base model, it's
available on HuggingFace as well: [proj-airi/games-balatro-2024-entities-detection](https://huggingface.co/datasets/proj-airi/games-balatro-2024-entities-detection).

The training was performed on a single NVIDIA 4080Super GPU with 16GB VRAM, the loss optimized well and converged within set 2000 epochs.
